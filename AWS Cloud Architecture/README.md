Diagram Explanation:

1. Global Services:
a. Used Amazon Route 53 for DNS and global load balancing and networking service AWS Global Accelerator for improving availability and performance.

2. Application Service: Backend application server can be deployed multiple AWS regions to ensure global availability.
   a. I used Use Amazon EC2 instances in Auto Scaling Groups to handle variable load.
   b. Implemented AWS Fargate for containerized applications.
   c. Implement an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic across backend instances.

3. Database:
   a. Implemented Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for the application db needs (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   b. Utilized read replicas to handle read-heavy traffic and distribute load as well.

4. Caching:
   a. Implemented Amazon ElastiCache for caching frequently accessed data.
   b. Redis or Memcached can be based on the application's requirements.

5. Background Jobs:
   a. Implemented AWS Lambda for serverless execution of background jobs.

6. External Systems Integration:
   a. Used Amazon API Gateway to manage and secure APIs.
   b. Implemented AWS Lambda functions to interact with external systems.
   c. Considered AWS App Runner for deploying and scaling APIs.

7. Content Delivery:
   a. Used Amazon CloudFront for content delivery to cache static content globally.
   b. For low latency access like images and videos took S3 bucket.

8. Monitoring and Logging:
   a. Implemented AWS CloudWatch for monitoring application health and performance.
   b. Use AWS CloudTrail for auditing and tracking API calls.

9. Security:
    a. Created AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage access control.
    b. Used AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption of sensitive data.
    c. Implemented security groups and network ACLs for network security.

10. Scaling:
    a. Set up Auto Scaling policies for EC2 instances and Fargate tasks.
    b. Configure RDS Auto Scaling for database instances.
    c. Utilized AWS Global Accelerator for additional global traffic optimization.
